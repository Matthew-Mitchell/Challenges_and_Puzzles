# Quadtrees

We are looking to design a simplified clustering algorithm know as quadtrees. To do this, your function should take 2 inputs from the user: n and k. Your algorithm should then generate n random points and then divide the space into quadrants recursively until no quadrant has more than k points within it. Your program should plot the space, quadrants, points and a summary of the following statistics: the total number of quadrants, and the quadrants that are the most densely packed.
