# Classification with Class Imbalance
Our client is a large travel agency that has asked us to build a model to predict whether a flight will be canceled based on several factors. Additionally, our client can only sell tickets for three airlines (AA,UA, and DL) and would like to be able to advise their customers on which airline has the least risk of cancellation.
Use the provided data to build a model that predicts whether a flight will be canceled.
