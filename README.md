# Challenges_and_Puzzles
Hi there! 

I love a good challenge or puzzle and hope you do too! If so, I think you'll like what you find here. Each folder will contain a seperate challenge with a description of the problem/puzzle as a readme. After all, the fun of a good challenge is trying it yourself first and wrapping your head around it! From there, you'll be able to find my own take on each the puzzles. 

Hope you enjoy and would love to hear from you concerning my work or additional challenges!
